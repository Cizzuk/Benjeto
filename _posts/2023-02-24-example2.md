It has been seven years since the Donut Kingdom faced its darkest hour. The once-thriving kingdom, renowned for its rich donut culture, was decimated by an invasion from a neighboring nation, desperate for donut resources. The invaders left the kingdom in ruins, but they could not extinguish the spirit of the Donutarians.

## Scattered Yet Unbroken

The Donutarians were forced to flee their homeland, becoming refugees scattered across the globe. Despite the loss and hardship, they have not forgotten their roots. They carry the legacy of the Donut Kingdom within their hearts, determined to keep their culture alive.

### The Birth of Benjeto

In their new homes, the Donutarians established a chain of donut shops named **Benjeto**, after the Esperanto word for donut. These shops serve as a beacon of their heritage, reminding the world of the Donut Kingdom's glory and raising funds for its eventual restoration.

### The Symbol of Donacat

Central to Benjeto's identity is **Donacat**, a deity worshipped by the Donutarians, depicted as a cat nestled in a donut hole. This symbol represents the unity and resilience of the Donutarians, a reminder that even in the smallest places, great strength can be found.

### Cultural Preservation

Benjeto shops are not just places to enjoy delicious donuts; they are cultural hubs where Donutarians and their new neighbors can learn about the rich traditions of the Donut Kingdom. Inside each shop, you'll find:

- **Cultural artifacts**: Items salvaged from the homeland, including traditional donut-making tools.
- **Educational displays**: Information about the history and significance of different donut types.
- **Community events**: Festivals and gatherings to celebrate Donutarian holidays and customs.

## A Glimpse into the Future

The Donutarians are united by a common goal: the restoration of their kingdom. Through Benjeto, they are gathering the resources needed to rebuild their homeland, one donut at a time. While the path to restoration is long and arduous, their unwavering dedication offers a glimmer of hope.
